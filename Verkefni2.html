				<h1>Project 2 - Computer aided cutting</h1>
				<h2>Part 1 - Vinyl cutter</h2>
				<p>For the vynil cutting part of this project I decided to cut out the logo of Team Spark, the Formula
					Student team that I am a part of. I started with a full colour version of the logo made in adobe
					illustrator and imported that into inkscape.</p>

									alt="" /></span></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>There i set fill to none, stroke paint to flat colour/black and stroke style width to 0.02mm. Now the
					logo was ready but I copy pasted until I had four of them in two different sizes. Then I exported as
					a pdf, selected the putter as a printer, clicked properties and clicked get from machine to see the
					length of the image, and put in a langth about 2 mm larger.</p>

				<h2>Part 2 - Laser cutter</h2>

				<h3>Gathering ideas</h3>
				<p>Me and Sæmundur desided to work together on projects 2 and 3 since in another class we are creating a
					soup feeding robot and thought that combining that project with laser cutting and 3D printing would
					be perfect. We chose to use Autodesk Fusion 360 as our CAD tool since it was recommended by the
					teacher, has relatively simple control over kerf (will be explained later) and has built in support
					for easy collaborations between users.</p>
				<p>I got the task of creating the arms of the robot that will provide strength and keep all the wires in
					the right places. <a
						href="https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/diy-arduino-robot-arm-with-smartphone-control/">
						Here </a> was one of my main inspirations for this project though the two projects are excecuted
					in very different ways.</p>
				<p>Worktime 2 hours</p>

				<h3>Measuring kerf</h3>
				<p>Kerf is a measurement for the amount of material removed by the laser, to ensure a tight fit you must
					extend all edges half of that amount which can prove a bit tricky but thankfully fusion has built in
					tools to take care of it.</p>
				<p><a href=https://saemi10.github.io/TolvustuddFramleidsla/V2.html#kerf>Here </a>you can see Sæmundurs
					documentation of the whole process of measuring the kerf for the laser cutter at the HÍ FabLab but I
					will include the results. The following settings were used giving a kerf of 0.133 mm for the acrylic
					and 0.167 mm for the plywood. </p>

				<p>Worktime 1 hour</p>

				<h3>Creating test fits</h3>
				<p>The arms will be made out of rectangular tubes, taller than they are wide to increase strength, with
					built in cross bracing and wiring holes at the end of the top piece. Sounds a bit complicated but
					will be very simple when you look at the finished product.</p>
				<p>To test the fit I created a short piece of the tube seen here.</p>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/Verk2/Test assembly.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>This tube uses 3 types of joints, finger joints for the corners, a press fit to connect the 2 braces
					and snap fits to connect the braces to the 4 sides</p>
				<p>Below you can see the drawing for the top piece as well as the vertical column. These are both drawn
					only using named parameters and derivatives there of using rectangular paterns for thi finger joints
					and mirror symmetry wherever possible. The sides and horizontal column are the exact same expept
					they switch lenght and width.</p>

					<div class="row gtr-uniform">
						<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Verk2/Test side.jpg"

						<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Verk2/test pieces.jpg"
									alt="" /></span></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>Below you can see all of the parameters that I used.</p>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/Verk2/test parameters.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>To account for kerf I followed <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKBxSx3Tv1k> this video</a> to
					learn how to account for kerf which gave me the following path that I exported as a pdf using the
					AutoCAD DXF Post library for Fusion found by searching dxf <a
						href=https://cam.autodesk.com/hsmposts> here </a>.</p>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/Verk2/Test path fusion.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Now that I had the dxf file it was time to import it into inkscape, make copies of the top and side
					pieces, position them relative to each other. Then I selected all of the pieces, selected Object ->
					Fill and stroke and input the following settings, fill = none, stroke paint = flat color and stroke
					style thickness = 0.02 mm. I then saved the file to an usb drive to move it to the laser cutter.</p>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/Verk2/test inkscape.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>After testing I noticed that a few things were wrong, I had accidentally set the kerf to 0.0133 mm
					and not 0.133 mm, the snap fits were to thin at 1 mm then to thick at 2 mm but 1.5 mm finally
					worked. The holes that the snap fit fingers fit into were originally the exact size of the fingers
					which was too tight, adding 0.6 mm to the lenght and 0.2 mm to the width fixed that. Finally the
					pressfits between the two columns was to loose at thickness + kerf and to tight at thickness + 0.06
					mm so I settled on thickness + 0.1 mm</p>
				<p>I had done test withboth black and clear acrylic and the resaults weren't consistant so I decided to
					cut the materials, turns out that the black one that I will be using for the final product is 3.15
					mm thick not 3 mm like it was supposed to be, that explains many of my problems but thankfully
					everything works now and here is the final succesfull test fit. I definetly should have measure
					everything earlier in the process, saving me many hours of testing.</p>
				<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row gtr-uniform">
						<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Verk2/IMG_20220214_172324.jpg"

									alt="" /></span></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>Worktime 12 hours</p>

				<h3>Final design</h3>
				<p>The final design was much the same as the test but with a few changes. The length was changed to 220
					mm, another set of columns was added and hooks were added to the top side so that rubber bands could
					assit the motors in the joints if needed. Thanks to heavy use of parameters the length of all 4
					sides could be changed to any multiple of 20 by changing just one number.</p>

						<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Verk2/arm 300mm with hooks.jpg"
									alt="" /></span></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>Finally this is how one of the 2 finished pieces came out, pre cleaning though. You can see that the
					ends are sanded down, that is because the material was 3.15 mm thick and not 3 mm but I forgot to
					change it in fusion and so to get the arms to fit into the 3D printed inserts I needed to sandthe
					first 10 mm from the ends down about 0.15mm, thankfully I had a dremel to make it easier. </p>
