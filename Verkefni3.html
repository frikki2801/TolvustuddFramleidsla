				<h1>Project 3 - 3D printing and scanning</h1>


				<h2>Part 1 - 3D scanning</h2>
				<p>For this project I decided to scan one of my nephew's toys and I decided to start with this
					firetruck. I began by taking 44 photos of the truck from all angles and importing them into <a
						href="https://www.3dflow.net/3df-zephyr-free/">3DF Zephyr free </a> However I was unable to get
					it to "recontruct" more than 11 of the photos and so the resaults were no good. </p>
				<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row gtr-uniform">
						<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img
									src="images/Verk3/scanning/IMG_20220224_133739.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>Next I tried taking some 120 more pictures and since zephyr only allows 50 pictures I tried the free
					<a href="https://www.regard3d.org/">Regard3D </a>. This did not work either, it alwasy gave me the
					error: Result file not found and after a
					quick google search it seemed to be a common bug with no known fix so again I set out to find a new
					program.
				</p>
				<p>
					Next i tried <a href="https://alicevision.org/">Meshroom </a> this one is a strange case since it
					was really easy to start but it gave no indication that it was doing anything. After clicking the
					Task manager tab it did show what it was doing. It used much of the CPU resorces available but only
					about 15% GPU and so was very slow despite me having a 6 core CPU and a RTX 3060 ti, the picture
					below is after waiting about two hours and it was only half way through.
				</p>
				<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row gtr-uniform">
						<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Verk3/scanning/meshroom.jpg"
									alt="" /></span></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>While vaiting for that I decided to google what android apps were available, Qlone was the one with
					the best reviews, a whole 2.1stars (an impressively low score but the other apps were even lower).
					For that I needed to print out this grid pattern and use a smaller object so I grabbed another toy,
					a dump truck this time around and followed the apps instructions.

					<div class="row gtr-uniform">
						<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Verk3/scanning/g truck.jpg"
									alt="" /></span></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>This was much faster and easier and gave me ok resaults.</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				<p>After a total of 3 hours of waiting meshroom it finally finished giving me something that did fit the
					pictures, kinda, but was nowhere close to the real thing and had no colours. </p>

				<h2>Part 2 - 3D printing</h2>
				<h3>Gathering ideas</h3>
				<p>Again me and Sæmundur desided to work together on projects 2 and 3 since in another class we are
					creating a soup feeding robot and thought that combining that project with laser cutting and 3D
					printing would
					be perfect. We chose to use Autodesk Fusion 360 as our CAD tool since it was recommended by the
					teacher, has relatively simple control over kerf (will be explained later) and has built in support
					for easy collaborations between users.</p>
				<p>For the 3D printing I got the task of making the elbow joint and the wrist joint, he made the
					shoulder joint and a fan housing.<a
						href="https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/diy-arduino-robot-arm-with-smartphone-control/">
						Here </a> was one of my main inspirations for this project though the two projects are excecuted
					in very different ways.</p>
				<p>Worktime 1 hours</p>

				<h3>Testing the printer</h3>
				<p>We used 2 Original Prusa i3 MK3S+ 3D printers for our work. It could handle overhangs of up to
					xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx degrees, perfectly handled bridging upto 25 mm and well enough up to 40
					mm.</p>
				<p>Worktime 2 hours</p>

				<h3>The elbow joint</h3>
				<p>This joint needed to be made to fit my towerpro SG-5010 servo, I found some of the dimensions online
					but not the ones that matter and so I began by measuring and drawing it up in Fusion.</p>
				<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row gtr-uniform">
						<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Verk3/Large servo.jpg"
									alt="" /></span></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Then I began by making the part of the joints that fits over the ends of the arms since it is
					shared with all 4 inserts on the robot, I gave it the thickness of 3 mm and made it go 10mm up
					the arm. This is visible on the left most image below. Then I went on to design the insert in
					image 2. These two were designed to keep the two arms in line and to provide &gt180° of
					movement.
				</p>
				<p>
					All 4 of the 3D printed parts I drew were made with heavy use of scetching, extruding that and then
					repeting on the newly created face.
				</p>
				<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row gtr-uniform">
						<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Verk3/Elbow up1.jpg"
									alt="" /></span></div>
						<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Verk3/Elbow down.jpg"

									alt="" /></span></div>
						<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Verk3/Elbow assembly.jpg"
									alt="" /></span></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>After designing this joint it was time to print it, we have access to a prusa printer so I began
					by exporting a 3mf file from fusion and importing that into <a
						href="https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/"> PrusaSlicer </a> Setting infill to 50%
					since these parts need to be strong and painting on supports under the overhangs. I forgot the
					supports at first but thankfully i realised that only 10 minutes in to the print so it was allright.
					I used orange prusa PLA for all of my prints,
				</p>
				<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row gtr-uniform">
						<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Verk3/Prusaslicer elbow.jpg"
									alt="" /></span></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>Sæmi had started his print an hour earlier than me and also forgot supports but that gave us this
					pretty reject.</p>
				<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row gtr-uniform">
						<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Verk3/print failed.jpg"
									alt="" /></span></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>So we added the supports and started the print again, this time it worked perfectly and so six hours
					later we had these 2 pretty pieces</p>
				<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row gtr-uniform">
						<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Verk3/printing1.1.jpg"

									alt="" /></span></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					After printing I realised that although the Elbow did indeed have about 200° of movement they were
					in the wrong place And I actually needed to offset the lower elbow joint 90°, the one with the big
					hole in the middle seen in the second to last photo above. This reqiered some "adjusments" to the
					insert but eventually it fit though it was now fastened with bolts through two new holes in it and
					the arm. But the upper elbow joint press fit perfectly... after alot of sanding down of the arm
					since the acrylic was 3.15 mm thick but not 3 mm like I thought it was.
				</p>

				<p>Worktime 8 hours</p>

				<h3>The wrist joint</h3>
				<p>The wrist joint fastens together a spoon and the upper arm with a small sg90 servo in the middle.
					Again I began by measuring and drawing the servo in fusion before building the joint around it.
				</p>
				<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row gtr-uniform">
						<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Verk3/Small servo.jpg"
									alt="" /></span></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					This joint was alot simpler to design
				</p>

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Here jou can see how I sliced it, again with 50% infill and painted on supports for overhangs.
